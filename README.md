# Random Walk
A data visualization project using Python. A random walk is a path that has no clear direction but is determined by a series of random decisions, each of which is left entirely to chance.

Random walks have practical applications in nature, physics, biology, chemistry, and economics. For example, a pollen grain floating on a drop of water moves across the surface of the water because it is constantly being pushed around by water molecules

Based on my studies of the book: Python Crash Course, 2nd Edition: A Hands-On, Project-Based Introduction to Programming
